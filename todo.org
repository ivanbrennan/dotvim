** figure out what's up with my Escape key (delay, international characters, etc.)
*** This started showing up when I configured iTerm to [[https://github.com/ivanbrennan/dotfiles/commit/df397385f72c4965bd2b80c18bd5bbe933ef5145][send +Esc for the left-option key]], in order to get Meta keys working in Neovim. This also meant [[https://github.com/ivanbrennan/dotvim/commit/d25ebca11429e118a308d6126cfdc18226cfb61b][changing the way I defined option-key bindings]] from hard-coding the special character macOS was sending, e.g.
#+begin_src vimscript
nnoremap âˆ† :cnext<CR>
#+end_src
to a more universal form
#+begin_src vimscript
nnoremap <M-j> :cnext<CR>
#+end_src
That was enough to get Meta keys working in Neovim, but for Vim I had to configure it to recognize the escape sequences being sent by iTerm:
#+begin_src vimscript
set  <F21>=^[j
map  <F21> <M-j>
map! <F21> <M-j>
#+end_src
That put me at the mercy of ~ttimeoutlen~, which I had set to 100 milliseconds. When I hit ~esc j~ quickly from Insert mode, Vim recognized this as ~^[j~ (were I in Normal mode it would've mapped to ~<M-j>~).

The solution was to [[https://github.com/ivanbrennan/dotvim/commit/e874f20b5d6379ad02fd2e3e6de7dd58c6a9df2c][reduce `ttimeoutlen` considerably]] (to 5 milliseconds).
** recompute folds
I've noticed that with 'foldmethod' set to syntax, folds don't automatically recompute as I edit the file. This is probably fine, as I'd rather not waste lots of cycles recomputing folds constantly, but I would like to manually trigger recomputing of folds from time to time. How can I do this?
